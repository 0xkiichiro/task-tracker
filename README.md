# Task Tracker

I was tasked to make a basic task tracker that allows you to add and remove tasks at your wish.

I wanted to spice things up by allowing you to assign a day of the week to your task and have some sort of weekly calendar.

All was going good until I decided to add the changes to the localStorage. I ended up bug fixing for a long time but ended up finishing the project without looking any additional resources. This is 100% my code.
